In the fictional Mining and Crafting Game, there are cuboid bees that occupy the game space, and these bees produce honey in Beehive blocks.

The beehive blocks are 1x1x1 blocks that have some x, y and z coordinates. In terms of the context for most of the tasks, this is all that is needed! See beehive.py for a definition, including some other statistics used in the final task.

For this final program, we'll be taking a look at a fictional sandbox game which allows you to both mine & craft.
In this game, there are bees which reside in beehives, and we'd like to represent this in code.

In this assignment, you'll work on the following features:

Some BST methods

A custom data structure implementation

Some bonus recursive methods

An optimisation problem

In doing this, you'll need to demonstrate knowledge on the following topics:

Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees

Heaps
