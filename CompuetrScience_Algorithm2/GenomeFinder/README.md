 In Molecular Genetics, there is a notion of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). An ORF is a
 portion of DNA that is used as the blueprint for a protein. All ORFs start with a particular
 sequence, and end with a particular sequence.
 In this task, we wish to find all sections of a genome which start with a given sequence of
 characters, and end with a (possibly) different given sequence of characters.
 To solve this problem, you will need to create a class OrfFinder. The constructor for this class
 takes a string genome as a parameter. Additionally, this class will need a method find(start,
 end).
