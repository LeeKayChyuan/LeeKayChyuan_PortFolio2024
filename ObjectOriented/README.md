Project Description
In this assignment, we will develop the “Static Factory” game, inspired by the game Lethal Company. We may use several similar names (characters, items, locations) and concepts. The purpose of using an actual game’s concepts is to help you visualise the required features, such as watching the video gameplay from the actual game to illustrate features that you may find challenging to comprehend. We also believe using actual game references may bring fun while working on the assignments. 

All linked game contents, videos, and images belong to the respective owners and are subject to copyright. We mainly use the concepts for educational purposes and provide credit to the original creators accordingly. We may also add, alter, and reduce the original content and features to make them more suitable to the game engine, unit outcomes, and assignments’ time frame.
